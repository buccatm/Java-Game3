# Java-Game3
This project was my first group game project. It was designed by Braden, Caelan and me. We implemented a ship game where the player must try to dodge as much astriod as possible. This is the first game we ever made, so the codes itself are messy and there are bugs present. The codes are old, created in 2017.
